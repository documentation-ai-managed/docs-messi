<Request tabs="cURL,JavaScript" show-lines="true">
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/v1/docs/{spaceId}/history \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

````javascript
const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/v1/docs/${spaceId}/history`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_TOKEN}`
  }
});
const history = await response.json();
````
</Request>

## Search and Filtering Capabilities

Search across all docs with full-text indexing. Filter by tags, dates, or authors for precise results.

| Feature | Description | Example Query |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Full-text Search | Matches titles and content | `authentication flow` |
| Tag Filtering | Narrows by labels | `tag:api` |
| Date Range | Recent changes only | `updated:>2024-01-01` |
| Author Filter | Specific contributors | `author:john@example.com` |

<Callout kind="info">
  Pro tip: Combine filters like `authentication tag:security updated:>2024-01-01` for targeted searches.
